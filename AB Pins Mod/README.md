# Trident AB Pins Mod

Incorporation of the pins modification into Voron Trident AB drives, based on [F3D files from the Voron Trident][voronTridentURL]
 and [STEP files from hartk's V2.4 pins mod][hartkPinModURL].

Appropriate portions from from hartk1213's README:

```
BOM:
[A-B] 
threaded @  30mm (x2)
smooth   @  28mm (x2)
```

> these can be purchased from here:

> - [Threaded pins](https://www.ebay.com/itm/%CF%865mm-%CF%8612mm-Female-Thread-Cylindrical-Pin-Dowel-Pins-A2-304-Stainless-Steel/184373551069)

> NOTE: 2 smooth pins can be substituted for the threaded pins. The reason the threaded pins are there is for easy removal without the need to remove the stepper, but if you don't plan on removing the pins without removing the stepper, then smooth pins would work just fine for you in this situation.
