November 14, 2021 UNTESTED:  AB Drive Units

November 14, 2021 Hartk1213's no wire path XY joint recreated in Fusion. (STL's are from Hartk1213's repository and unchanged, his CAD files had not been posted.)





Incorporation of pins modification to Voron Trident AB drives, based on f3d files from 
[https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident "https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident")
and
step files from
[https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Pins_Mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Pins_Mod "https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Pins_Mod")

US 3dp retailer of kit with pins for this mod, plus the pin mod XY joint and pin mod AB tensioner:

AB Drive Units in this repository are my derivations.


Included in this repository are the Trident pin mod XY joints and pin mod front idlers from hartk1213's for convenience.

")


NOTE: 2 smooth pins can be substituted for the threaded pins, the reason the threaded pins are there is for easy removal without the need to remove the stepper. but if you dont plan on removing the pins without removing the stepper than smooth pins would work just fine for you in this situation.
